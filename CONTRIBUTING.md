# Contributing to PHPTurnTracker

Thank you for considering contributing to PHPTurnTracker! This document outlines the development workflow, coding standards, and guidelines for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple code of conduct:

- **Be respectful**: Treat all contributors with respect and professionalism
- **Be constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and suggestions
- **Be collaborative**: Work together to improve the project
- **Be inclusive**: Welcome contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **PHP 8.1+** (strict requirement)
- **Composer** for dependency management
- **Git** for version control
- Recommended: VS Code with devcontainer and PHP extensions

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codryn/phpturntracker.git
   cd phpturntracker
   ```

Note: Its is recommended to use the proviced vs code devcontainer for consistent environment. Please refere to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers for more information.

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   composer test        # Run all tests
   composer analyse     # Run static analysis
   composer cs-check    # Check code style
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

PHPTurnTracker follows strict TDD practices:

1. **Write tests first** before implementing features
2. **Run tests** to see them fail (red)
3. **Implement** the minimum code to pass (green)
4. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
5. **Repeat** for each feature increment

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run with coverage and HTML report
composer test-coverage-html

### Code Quality

```bash
# PSR-12 compliance check and fix
composer cs-check
composer cs-fix

# Static analysis (PHPStan 2.1 level 10 strict)
composer analyse

# Run all quality checks
composer ci
```

### Strict Types

All PHP files must declare strict types:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);
```
### Type Hints

- Use PHP 8.1 type hints for all parameters and return values
- Document complex types with PHPDoc annotations
- Use union types when appropriate (e.g., `string|null`)

### PHPDoc Blocks

All public methods must have comprehensive PHPDoc blocks:

```php
/**
 * Brief description of what the method does
 *
 * @param int $year Year to check
 * @param bool $strict Enable strict validation
 * @return bool True if valid
 * @throws InvalidArgumentException if year is invalid
 */
public function isValid(int $year, bool $strict = false): bool
{
    // implementation
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- **Target overall coverage**: 80%+
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage required
  - All public methods
  - Error handling paths
  - Edge cases

### Test Organization

```
tests/
├── Acceptance/      # Acceptance tests for user stories
├── Contract/        # API Contract tests (planned)
├── Unit/            # Unit tests (isolated, fast)
└── Integration/     # Integration tests (end-to-end)
```

### Writing Tests

See existing tests for examples. Key guidelines:
- Use descriptive test method names: `testCreateGregorianCalendarWithCorrectProperties()`
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- One assertion concept per test
- Use data providers for testing multiple scenarios

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Run all checks**
   ```bash
   composer ci
   ```

2. **Update documentation**
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Add/update API documentation
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

3. **Write a clear PR description**
   - What: Brief summary of changes
   - Why: Reason for the change
   - How: Technical approach
   - Testing: How you tested the change

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] PHPStan 2.1 Level 10 Strict passes
- [ ] PSR-12 code style applied
- [ ] All files have `declare(strict_types=1)`
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (for features/fixes)
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feature`: New feature
- `bug`: Bug fix
- `task`: Any other change

**Example:**
```
feature/savage-world: Add exploding dice support for Savage Worlds

Implement explosion mechanic where dice roll again on max value.
Configurable explosion limit prevents infinite loops.

Closes #42
```
